# The next logical step is to deal with handling user input. When a player (say player 1, who is X) wants to place
# an X on the screen, they canâ€™t just click on a terminal. So we are going to approximate this clicking simply
# by asking the user for a coordinate of where they want to place their piece. The computer asks Player 1 (X)
# what their move is (in the format row,col), and say they type 1,3. Then the game would print out
# and ask Player 2 for their move, printing an O in that place.
